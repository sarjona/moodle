Feature: Make an LTI only available to specific course categories
  In order to restrict which courses a tool can be used in
  As an administrator
  I need to be able to select which course category the tool is available in

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |
      | teacher1 | Terry1    | Teacher1 | teacher1@example.com |
    And the following "categories" exist:
      | name  | category | idnumber |
      | cata  | 0        | cata     |
      | catca | cata     | catca    |
      | catb  | 0        | catb     |
      | catcb | catb     | catcb    |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category |
      | Course 1 | C1 | cata  |
      | Course 2 | C2 | catb  |
      | Course 3 | C3 | catca |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user | course | role |
      | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |
      | teacher1 | C2 | editingteacher |
      | teacher1 | C3 | editingteacher |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Plugins > Activity modules > External tool > Manage tools" in site administration
    And I follow "Manage preconfigured tools"
    And I follow "Add preconfigured tool"
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Tool name | Teaching Tool 1 |
      | Tool configuration usage | Show as preconfigured tool when adding an external tool |
      | catb | 1 |
    And I set the field "Tool URL" to local url "/mod/lti/tests/fixtures/tool_provider.php"
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I navigate to "Plugins > Activity modules > External tool > Manage tools" in site administration
    And I follow "Manage preconfigured tools"
    And I follow "Add preconfigured tool"
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I click on "cata" "link"
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Tool name | Teaching Tool 2 |
      | Tool configuration usage | Show in activity chooser and as a preconfigured tool |
      | catca | 1 |
    And I set the field "Tool URL" to local url "/mod/lti/tests/fixtures/tool_provider.php"
    And I press "Save changes"

  Scenario: Tool is set to "Show as preconfigured tool when adding an external tool" on parent category
    Given I log in as "teacher1"
    When I am on "Course 2" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I add a "External tool" to section "1"
    Then "Teaching Tool 1" "text" should exist in the "Preconfigured tool" "select"

  Scenario: Tool is set to "Show in activity chooser and as preconfigured tool" on child category
    Given I log in as "teacher1"
    When I am on "Course 3" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I open the activity chooser
    Then I should see "Teaching Tool 2" in the "Add an activity or resource" "dialogue"

  Scenario: Tool restrict access
    Given I log in as "teacher1"
    When I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I open the activity chooser
    Then I should not see "Teaching Tool 2" in the "Add an activity or resource" "dialogue"

  Scenario: Editing and saving selected parent / child categories
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Plugins > Activity modules > External tool > Manage tools" in site administration
    And I follow "Manage preconfigured tools"

      | Tool configuration usage | Do not show; use only when a matching tool URL is entered |
      | catb | 1 |
    # If parent is selected, child should be selected.
    And the field "catcb" matches value "1"
    # If parent is unselected, child should be unselected.
    And I set the following fields to these values:
    | catb | 0 |
    And the field "catcb" matches value "0"
    # If parent is selected, child is unselected, parent should still be selected.
    # Step 1 - Select parent first so child is selected.
    And I set the following fields to these values:
    | catb  | 1 |
    And the field "catcb" matches value "1"
    # Step 2 - Unselect child but parent should stay as selected.
    And I set the following fields to these values:
    | catcb | 0 |
    And the field "catb" matches value "1"
    And I set the field "Tool URL" to local url "/mod/lti/tests/fixtures/tool_provider.php"
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I wait "2" seconds
    And I should see "Teaching Tool 3"

    Then the following fields match these values:
      | catb  | 1 |
